# Packman
A simple, project based, houdini loader and package manager for Linux.

## How different from a regular Houdini launcher ?

In Packman you can customize Houdini versions, products (FX/Core/Indie), and json packages per project, in a nice and clean user interface.

## How it works:
1. Collect all your .json packages into a repository folder.
2. Make sure to remove them from your user folder (they will now be loaded on demand, by Packman).
3. Add a new Packman project, choose versions and packages you wish to load.
4. Open your Houdini from there, always.
5. Done. Now you can quick setup project environments with just a fews clicks.

*Archive old projects to clean the UI, but keep track of all settings in case you ever need to re-open project files.*
